  <summary><strong>paradigm</strong></summary>

  a paradigm is a set of rules and regulations that does two things:
  1. it establishes and defines boundaries; and
  2. it tells you how to behave inside those boundaries to be successful.

  words that represent subsets of the paradigm concept: theory, model, methodology, principles, standards, protocol, routines, assumptions, conventions, patterns, habits, common sense, conventional wisdom, mind-set, values, frames of reference, traditions, customs, prejudices, idealogy, inhibitions, superstitions, rituals, compulsions, addictions, doctrine, dogma.

  words like culture, organization, worldview, business, education did not appear because they are forests of paradigms.
