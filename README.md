  <summary><strong>determinism</strong></summary><br>

determinism is the philosophical belief that **all events are determined completely by previously existing causes**. the opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called nondeterminism) or randomness. determinism is often contrasted with free will.

### in computer science

determinism in computer science means, if we have a computing device and a state the device is in. **if for every such state, by a given input, there is at most one state that can follow, then the device is called deterministic. if there are two or more states that can follow, then the device is non-deterministic**. note that non-determinism doesn't mean we don't know which states can follow but that they be multiple.

also, randomness and non-determinism are two separate notions in computer science. randomness means that given a state, the next state depends upon the result of a random draw from some "set", like a coin toss.

a **deterministic algorithm** is an algorithm which, **given a particular input, will always produce the same output**, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. but in case of **non-deterministic algorithm**, for the same input, the algorithm may produce different output in different runs.

  <summary><strong>paradigm</strong></summary><br>

a paradigm is a set of rules and regulations that does two things:
1. it establishes and defines boundaries; and
2. it tells you how to behave inside those boundaries to be successful.

words that represent subsets of the paradigm concept: theory, model, methodology, principles, standards, protocol, routines, assumptions, conventions, patterns, habits, common sense, conventional wisdom, mind-set, values, frames of reference, traditions, customs, prejudices, idealogy, inhibitions, superstitions, rituals, compulsions, addictions, doctrine, dogma.

words like culture, organization, worldview, business, education did not appear because they are forests of paradigms.
